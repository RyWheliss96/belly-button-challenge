## Instructions
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.<br />
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


## Repository_Contents
There are 2 coding deliverables. The first is static/app.js which contains the javascript code for the challenge. It contains all of the manipulation and visualization of the dataset The second is index.html which was mainly given to us though I made a few changes to better fit my code specifically.<br />

## Questions
There were no big questions asked in this challenge. The data is displayed at this site: https://rywheliss96.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ <br />
Below you will find a sample view of the data <br />

## Givens
Most of my process was very straight forward. I completed all of the working testing along the way.<br />
All code was generated by myself.<br />
